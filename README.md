# 🐍 Snake Game in Java

A classic Snake Game built with Java using `JPanel`, `Graphics`, and `KeyListener`.  
Inspired by a YouTube tutorial, but implemented and customized by me to better understand Java game development and GUI programming.

## Features
- Smooth snake movement using arrow keys
- Snake grows with each apple eaten
- Grid-based game environment
- Score tracking system
- Game over screen
- Responsive keyboard controls

## What I Learned
- Java Swing (`JPanel`, `JFrame`, `Timer`)
- Real-time game loop with `ActionListener`
- Handling keyboard input with `KeyAdapter`
- Collision detection logic
- Object-oriented programming principles

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java
- Java Swing (`javax.swing`)
- AWT graphics and event handling
